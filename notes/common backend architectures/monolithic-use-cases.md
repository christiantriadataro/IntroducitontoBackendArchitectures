#### Monolithic
##### Use Cases
- Small-scale applications: Given its simplicity, a monolithic architecture is often
  suitable for small-scale applications or startups where the application's scope
  is clear and unlikely to drastically change or scale.

- Applications with simple, well-defined business processes: Monolithic
  architecture can be beneficial in scenarios where the business process are simple 
  and unlikely to require significant changes or scenarios.

- Applications where high performance is critical: Since all functionalities
  are interconnected, a monolithic architecture can provide faster inter-process 
  communication compared to other architectures.
