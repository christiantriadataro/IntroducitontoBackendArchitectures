#### Uber

As it expanded worldwide, Uber transitioned from a monolithic to a 
microservices' architecture. Each service, such as ride-hailing, 
food delivery, and driver-partner services,
is managed by a separate microservice. This has enabled Uber to scale 
and customize its service for different markets.
