### Introduction to Backend Architecture
#### Quote from AI
`Mastering something isn't a matter of precise science;
 it's a craft honed through the persistent trial of experience,
 learning and adapting as we navigate the ever-
 unfolding journey.`

`learn, adapt and grow.`

##### Design Stages
1. Research
2. Implement 
3. Iterate


##### Research
###### Setting Requirements
- Identify the primary purpose and scope of the system.
- Understand the needs and expectations of the end-users of the system
- Determine the functionality that the system needs to provide to meet
  the end-users' needs.
- Specify the performance levels that the system needs to achieve.
- Identify any constraints or limitations, such as budget, resources, or time.
- Consider the scalability needs of the system - how it can grow and adapt to 
  increased demand.
- Determine any security requirements to protect data and processes within the system.
- Identify any regulatory or compliance requirements that the system needs to meet.
- Specify the requirements for integrating the new system with existing systems.

##### Exploration
- Research and testing of new technologies.
- Experimenting and new methodologies and tools.
- Determine if the goal is to improve the system design entirely (innovation) or make
  small changes where needed (iteration).

##### Technical Documents
- Used for understanding possible explored solutions or ideas which keep the project
  on path.
- Provide detailed descriptions of the explored systems, including architectures,
  modules, interfaces, and data relevant to the project.
- Reference for the development team and other stakeholders.
- Facilitate communication and collaboration


##### Implementing System Designs
- Chose the appropriate design
- Define the architecture
- Develop the architecture
- Test the architecture
- Deploy the architecture
- Maintain the architecture


##### Chose the appropriate design
- Choose the system design that best fits the project requirements, team expertise,
  budget, and time constraints outlined in technical documents mentioned.


##### Define the Architecture
- Document the system's architecture, including its modules, interfaces, and data.


##### Develop the Architecture
- Begin the development process, ensuring that each component of the architecture is 
  working on its specific task.

##### Test the Architecture
- Conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues and to ensure that the 
  architecture meetings the project requirements.


##### Deploy the Architecture
- Once the architecture passes all tests, deploy it in a controllable production
  environment.


##### Maintain the Architecture
- Regularly update and maintain the architecture to ensure its ongoing effectiveness
  and to accommodate any changes in project requirements or business needs.


#### Best Practices
- Involve all stakeholders from the beginning to ensure their needs and expectations are 
  met. (SLAs, SLOs)
- Plan for scalability from the beginning to prepare for future growth.
- Design systems to be robust and flexible to handle errors or unexpected inputs
  and accommodate changes.
- Consider security needs throughout the design and development process.
- Keep up with the latest technological trends to make informed design decisions.
- Incorporate feedback from users to improve the system design.
